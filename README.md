# Memory Match (aka Concentration)

## Overview

> Memory match is a game with 20 cards face down and the player has to try and match all 10 pairs of matching cards by remembering the position of the cards.
Once the player has match 2 cards they will be displayed face up until all pairs have been matched. Once all pairs have been matched the user will be
displayed a message that they have won the game. As the user clicks through the cards stats will be kept letting the user know how many attempts and the
accuracy of their choices.

## Features
#####1. NASCAR Theme - match driver to driver
#####2. Counts stats for matches, attempts, accuracy, and wins
#####3. Feature for flipping cards back over in case of no match
#####4. Game displays on mobile landscape or larger display

##Future ideas to implement
#####1. Add timer
#####2. Add shuffle feature
#####3. Create a total of six levels as follows:
> ##### - Two main levels - the easy level will be matching driver to driver and the hard level will match driver to car
> ##### - In each main level, there will be three levels of four, six, and ten matching pairs with increasing timers
#####4. The stats display on the left will resemble a racetrack score tower
#####5. The background will play a video upon a win
